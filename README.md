This story takes place eighteen years ago, when most people did not even know of the existence of 
the Internet, and personal computers were normally thought of as standalone devices.
In a town called Kuniritsu, a suburb of Tokyo, there was a school known as Jusho High. Everything 
began in this school one day when a tall student impatiently burst into a room at the end of class. He 
stormed across the classroom to stop at the seat of a handsome young man who stood out from the rest 
of his class and ominously slammed the top of the desk.
"You Nakajima?"
"Yes, that's me..."
Ignoring the sudden vibration that the desk sent through his body, Nakajima Akemi resolutely stood 
up and looked the student in the eye. Kondo Hiroyuki was the captain of the karate club and the 
unofficial student "boss" of Jusho High. More than one student whom had dared oppose him had been 
forced to change schools--usually through violent means. Nakajima had never even interacted with 
Kondo before; he certainly couldn't think of anything that he might have done to make him this angry.
What gives? I haven't done anything.
Nakajima gulped and started to open his parched mouth to speak. At that moment, he heard a 
suppressed giggle from behind him. Nakajima his head and saw her. Bewitching, charming, she almost 
seemed too sophisticated to be a student. She was staring at him, her catlike gaze alluring yet full of 
malice. It was one of his classmates, Takamizawa Kyoko. Nakajima suddenly understood everything.
"Hold on a minute!"
The same instant Nakajima spoke, a fist flew into his solar plexus. Without even a chance to cry out, 
Nakajima fell to the floor. Kondo followed up his punch with a low kick. That was followed by single kicks 
to the chest and the lower stomach--carefully placed with enough force to hurt badly, but not knock 
their target out. Afraid of getting involved, Nakajima's classmates started to leave the classroom one by 
one.
"Hear me out...." Nakajima tried hard to protest, but his voice was silenced when Kondo's foot 
slammed into his mouth. His tears and saliva spilled out all over the floor.
"I don't wanna hear your excuses. You gotta learn what happens to people who come on to Kyoko."
Kondo kicked Nakajima in the back, flipping him onto his stomach. Kyoko, gleefully watching him get
pummeled, kneeled down in front of him and flicked his upper lip with her fingers.
"He's got a face like a woman, and he still tried to kiss me!"
"Liar..."
Actually, Kyoko had tried to kiss him, and Nakajima had just pushed her away. Her pride hurt, Kyoko
had used Kondo and his large crush on her to get her revenge. But Nakajima didn't have a single friend 
to corroborate his story. Only his classmate Takai Ken'ichi remained in the room, and even he just stood 
there, worriedly looking at Nakajima through his dark green-rimmed glasses; apparently, he lacked the 
courage to stop Kondo.
Kondo pulled Nakajima up from the floor with just his left hand before he thrust his right fist into 
Nakajima's solar plexus again. It felt like his heart was being torn out; Nakajima tried to cry out, but with

the wind knocked out of him, he could neither inhale nor exhale, and all that left his injured lips was a 
pathetic little moan.
Nakajima had always been something of an independent maverick, not wanting to hurt anyone or 
get hurt himself, so he had never been beaten like this before. And to think this was over some stupid 
reason like rejecting a girl! The combined sensations of pain, anger, and humiliation overwhelmed him, 
and the wound in his psyche started to bleed, a drop at a time. Seeing him like this, Kyoko watched 
Nakajima with a look of pure ecstasy in her eyes, and laughed out loud. The sound of her high-pitched 
laugh reverberating throughout the classroom pierced Nakajima's eardrums and echoed in his skull, 
awakening an emotion he had never experienced before.
Damn you...I'll get you...you won't get away with this...
Nakajima's eyes lit up with a fierce, violent look he had never worn before.
"What's with that look?"
Kondo was taken aback for a second by Nakajima's expression. As if mad at himself for faltering, he 
punched Nakajima hard in the face. At the sound of Nakajima's tooth cracking, Kyoko, as if she had lost 
interest in the whole thing, asked, "Hey, don't you think that's enough?" 
It was the voice of a dirty, cowardly woman, worried only about protecting herself; if Nakajima was 
beaten any harder, there was a real danger of her being held responsible.
"Hey, lucky you! Looks like you've gotten a reprieve. I've gotta say I'm surprised at what a weak little 
runt you are. Beating you up was just a waste of energy." His mouth twisted into a smile, Kondo 
unceremoniously dumped Nakajima's body on the floor like a rag doll.
An hour later, after finally being able to move, Nakajima reached the Chuo-sen Kunitachi train
station, supported by Takai.
"Why don't we sit down?" 
Still propping Nakajima up, Takai cocked his head in the direction of two open seats nearby.
"Eh? ...oh, sure."
Nakajima collapsed onto the seat and stared forward resolutely, all the while regretting he had ever 
applied to his school.
Jusho Private High was a famous and prestigious school; every year more than twenty of its students 
were admitted to Tokyo University. However, anyone familiar with the way the school worked would 
acknowledge the extreme stratification amongst the students. The school was divided into two groups,
the general class, and the "gifted" class. The gifted class received better facilities, better curricula, better 
teaching materials, and in general were favored much more highly. The gifted class comprised about 
twenty percent of the student body and was always the target of constant jealousy and disgruntlement 
from the general class. With such a gulf between the two, the violent incidents born from this jealousy 
were to an extent unavoidable.
Both Nakajima and Takai were part of the gifted class. With his slender frame and delicate looks, if 
Nakajima swapped his uniform for a girl's sailor suit, he might very well be able to pass for a beautiful 
teenage girl. Takai's appearance, on the other hand, was the polar opposite. Judo practice since junior 
high had given him a rugged body and thick fingers. But his personality was not as tough as his exterior, 
and when he put on his glasses, he looked almost childlike.

"That Kondo, he seemed even worse than usual today," Takai said, almost as if making excuses; he 
felt a little guilty for not stepping in to help Nakajima.
Nakajima raised an eyebrow and responded half-heartedly. "His energy doubles whenever he's near 
a woman."
"What the heck is someone like Kyoko doing in the gifted class anyway? Besides, you'd never come
on to her in the first place."
"Actually...it was the other way around."
"So it was Kyoko that got rejected, then." 
Takai nodded as everything suddenly made sense. Lots of girls were interested in Nakajima, but 
none of them so far had been able to strike his fancy. Seeing his indifference, Takai always guessed that 
Nakajima must have extremely finicky tastes when it came to women.
The two sat next to each other in silence as the train passed through Musashi-Sakai station. Takai 
took a sidelong glance at Nakajima's profile. Among the students of the gifted class, Nakajima's grades 
were not particularly high. In contrast to Takai, who got good grades in just about everything, Nakajima 
was really only good at math and science. In the more liberal arts, the only subject he showed real 
strength in was world history. He wasn't much of an athlete either. 
However, when it came to computers, nobody in school came even close to Nakajima--not even the 
teachers. Takai thought that you probably wouldn't be able to find someone who was as good as 
Nakajima in that arena if you searched all of Japan, let alone the school. The games that Nakajima would 
whip up in a matter of days were fantastic. No matter how popular they were, commercial games just 
seemed boring after playing one of Nakajima's. Sometimes Nakajima's expression looked positively mad 
as he hunched over one of the terminals writing programs in the school's CAI (Computer Aided 
Instruction) room, his fingers flying across the keyboard.
If I'm a prodigy, then Nakajima must be a bona-fide genius. Takai nodded to himself as his gaze 
turned back to the scenery passing by outside the window.
"Demons, eh...?" The words tumbled out of Nakajima's mouth suddenly.
"Eh?"
"No, never mind."
"Did you just..."
Just as Takai pursed his lips as if to say something, the train arrived at Nishi-Ogikubo station.
"See you."
Nakajima started to walk down the station stairs with his shoulders hunched and a brooding 
expression on his face.
"Geez, what is he thinking?" 
Turning away from Nakajima, Takai plopped himself down on the two now-empty seats of the train.
